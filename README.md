> **What is this?** A standalone video downloader called **独轮车 (DL Cart)** that integrates the full power of [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) into a single double-clickable `.exe`. No Python, no FFmpeg, no command line — just paste a URL and download.

## What It Can Do

Everything yt-dlp can do, accessible through a clean GUI:

### Core Download Engine

- **1000+ sites supported** — YouTube, Bilibili, Twitter/X, TikTok, Douyin, Vimeo, and many more (same as yt-dlp)
- **Best quality by default** — Automatically selects the best available video + audio streams and merges them
- **Quality presets** — 4K, 1080p, 720p, 480p, or audio-only, one click to switch
- **Custom format string** — Advanced users can enter any yt-dlp format string directly
- **Speed limiting** — Cap download bandwidth (KB/s), useful on shared connections

### Subtitles & Metadata

- **10+ subtitle languages** — English, Chinese (Simplified / Traditional), Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, German, Russian, auto-detect
- **Auto-generated subtitles** — Download machine-generated subtitles where available
- **Thumbnail embedding** — Automatically embeds video thumbnails into downloaded files
- **Metadata tagging** — Writes title, uploader, and other metadata via FFmpeg

### Download Management

- **Concurrent downloads** — Up to 10 simultaneous downloads (configurable)
- **Queue system** — Add multiple URLs, they download in order as slots free up
- **Cancel & retry** — Cancel in-progress downloads cleanly; retry failed ones with one click
- **Persistent history** — Last 200 downloads saved to disk, survives app restart
- **Right-click actions** — Cancel / Retry / Open File / Open Folder / Delete from list

### Real-Time Monitoring

- **Visual progress bar** — Unicode block bar `████░░░░ 45%` updates in real time
- **Speed & ETA** — Live download speed and estimated time remaining
- **File size tracking** — Shows total and downloaded bytes
- **Color-coded status** — Green = done, Yellow = downloading, Red = failed

### System Integration

- **Bundled FFmpeg** — ffmpeg.exe is packed inside the EXE, zero external dependencies
- **Windows notifications** — Toast notification pops up when a download finishes
- **Dark / Light theme** — Switch in settings, dark mode by default
- **Proxy support** — Configure HTTP/SOCKS proxy for restricted networks
- **Safer proxy handling** — Ignores broken `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment settings unless you explicitly configure a proxy in the app
- **Cookie fallback** — If browser cookie access fails, the app automatically retries without browser cookies when possible

## 🔒 Windows SmartScreen Warning

When you run the EXE for the first time, Windows may show:

> *"Windows protected your PC"*

This is a **false positive** — the app is built from [public source code](https://github.com/HaipingShi/ytdlp-lh) by GitHub Actions. It happens because the EXE is not code-signed.

**How to bypass:**

1. Click **"More info"**
2. Click **"Run anyway"**

If you prefer not to bypass it, you can [build the EXE yourself from source](#building-from-source) or [run directly with Python](#running-from-source).

---

## Download & Install

### Windows EXE (Recommended)

1. Go to **[Latest Release](https://github.com/HaipingShi/ytdlp-lh/releases/latest)**
2. Download `DLCart.exe`
3. Double-click to run — no installer, no dependencies

The EXE already includes yt-dlp + FFmpeg. It just works.

### Running from Source

Requirements: Python 3.8+, Windows / macOS / Linux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaipingShi/ytdlp-lh.git
cd ytdlp-lh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ytdlp_gui.py
```

> FFmpeg should be installed separately if running from source. On Windows, place `ffmpeg.exe` next to `ytdlp_gui.py`. If you want browser-based extraction fallback for supported sites, also run `python -m playwright install chromium`.

### Building from Source

```bash
pip install pyinstaller yt-dlp playwright
python -m playwright install chromium

# Windows (bundles ffmpeg.exe if present in current dir)
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --collect-all yt_dlp ^
  --add-binary "ffmpeg.exe;." --add-binary "ffprobe.exe;." ^
  --name DLCart ytdlp_gui.py
```

## Quick Start

1. **Double-click** `DLCart.exe`
2. **Paste** any video URL into the input box (Ctrl+V)
3. **Pick quality** — leave "Best" for maximum quality
4. **Click Download**
5. Done — click **"Open File"** in the right-click menu to play it

## Simple Usage Guide

If this is your first time using DL Cart, follow this flow:

1. Open `DLCart.exe`
2. Copy a video page link from your browser
3. Paste the link into the **Video URL** box
4. Leave **Best Quality** selected unless you want a smaller file
5. Click **Download**
6. Wait for the row to change to `COMPLETED`
7. Right-click the finished row and choose **Open File** or **Open Folder**

Tips:

- If a site needs login, open **Advanced** or **Settings** and choose a browser in **Cookie Browser**
- If your network requires a proxy, enter it in **Proxy URL**
- If a download fails, right-click the row and choose **Retry**
- If you only want audio, select **Audio Only** before downloading

### Beginner-Friendly Walkthrough

Here is the easiest way to use the app without touching advanced settings:

1. Open the video in your browser and copy the full page URL
2. Return to DL Cart and paste the URL into the top input box
3. Keep the quality on **Best Quality**
4. Click **Download**
5. Watch the task appear in the list below

What you will see:

- `QUEUED` means the task is waiting for a free slot
- `DOWNLOADING` means the file is actively downloading
- `PROCESSING` means yt-dlp / FFmpeg is finishing the file
- `COMPLETED` means the file is ready to open
- `FAILED` means something went wrong and you can use **Retry**

When you need Advanced or Settings:

- Use **Audio Only** if you want music, podcasts, or spoken content only
- Use **Proxy URL** only if your network really requires a proxy
- Use **Cookie Browser** only for sites that require login or age/account verification
- Leave advanced settings empty for normal public videos

Three common examples:

1. Download a normal public video:
   Paste the link, keep **Best Quality**, click **Download**
2. Download only audio:
   Paste the link, choose **Audio Only**, click **Download**
3. Download a members-only / login-required video:
   Paste the link, open **Advanced**, choose your browser in **Cookie Browser**, then download

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows says "protected your PC"</strong></summary>

This is SmartScreen blocking an unsigned app. Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**. See the [Security Notice](#-windows-smartscreen-warning) section above for details and alternatives.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Video downloads but has no audio</strong></summary>

This means video and audio streams were not merged. Make sure FFmpeg is available. If using the EXE, FFmpeg is bundled and this shouldn't happen. If running from source, install FFmpeg.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Unsupported URL" error</strong></summary>

- Check your internet connection
- Make sure the URL works in a browser
- The site might require login, be region-locked, or not be supported by yt-dlp yet
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Downloads are slow</strong></summary>

- Try setting a speed limit (Settings → Speed Limit) — some servers throttle aggressive connections
- Select a lower quality to reduce file size
- Your ISP might be throttling video traffic — try a VPN
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Downloads fail because of a proxy error</strong></summary>

- If you did not explicitly configure a proxy in the app, DL Cart ignores `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` from the shell environment
- If you do need a proxy, set it in **Advanced** or **Settings** instead of relying on environment variables
- If downloads still fail, clear the in-app proxy field and try again
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Browser cookie loading fails</strong></summary>

- Some Windows/browser setups block access to the browser cookie database while the browser is running
- DL Cart automatically retries without browser cookies when possible
- If the site truly requires login, open **Advanced** or **Settings** and choose the correct browser only when needed
- Leaving **Cookie Browser** blank is the safest default for public videos
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>App won't start</strong></summary>

**EXE version:**

- Requires Windows 10 1809+
- Right-click → Properties → check "Unblock" if downloaded from the internet
- Try Run as Administrator

**Python version:**

- Ensure Python 3.8+: `python --version`
- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check `dlcart.log` for error details
</details>
